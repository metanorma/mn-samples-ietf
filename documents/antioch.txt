                    The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
                     draft-camelot-holy-grenade-01

Abstract

   The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140 may be
   usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of Internet and more
   general lore.  This document extends the menagerie to the seminal
   fable of the "Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", as depicted in the Monty
   Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", as well as "Spamalot",
   the musical inspired by the movie.

Spamalot

   The relevance of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be
   obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also Section 1
   ("What is Spam*?") of [RFC2635].

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "*NOT RECOMMENDED*", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   [RFC8140] refers to the intended move of RFC formatting to XML2RFC v3
   [RFC7990], in the following terms:

   |  Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
   |  screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996], there is
   |  a yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep
   |  it simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be
   |  given thrust without anyone taking undue offence.
   |  
   |  -- A.  Farrel

   While no pigs, flying or otherwise, are involved in the transition to
   RFC XML v3, it is opportune to enhance the [RFC8140] legendarium in
   the service of RFC XML v3, by illustrating its functionality through
   references to the mythology of Camelot, and particularly the
   incidents at the Cave of Caerbannog.

Internet-Draft           Hand Grenade of Antioch            January 2020


   The screaming move into the twenty-*first* century is accompanied by
   a move back to the late twentieth century, with ASCII stylings more
   wonted in haunts like ftp://ftp.wwa.com/pub/Scarecrow (known to be
   accessible in 1996.)

   There are two references to rabbits in _Monty Python and the Holy
   Grail_ which are expounded on herewith:

   Trojan Rabbit  In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may
      already contain an instance of the Grail, Sir Bedevere the Wise
      proposes to use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the castle, with a
      raiding party to take the French "not only by surprise, but
      totally unarmed."

      The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive.  The more so as the
      raiding party forgot to hide within the Trojan Rabbit, before the
      French soldiers took the Trojan Rabbit inside the castle.

   Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog  Guarding the entrance to the Cave of
      Caerbannog; see Clause 5 (Section 4).

3.  The French-occupied castle

   The participants of that renowned exercise in cross-cultural
   communication, to wit the exchange between the _Knights of the Round
   Table_ and the taunting French soldiers serving under *Guy de
   Lombard* are, properly speaking, outside the scope of this
   "menagerie", being more or less human.  Notwithstanding,
   several^(ish) beasts both animate_(d) and wooden played a significant
   part in this encounter; most notably:

   *  The Projectile Cow, see Figure 1

   *  The Trojan Rabbit, see Figure 2

   The exchange of projectile animals was the beginning of a long-
   running fruitful relationship between the British and the French
   peoples, which arguably predates the traditional English enmity with
   the French.

4.  The Mythos of Caerbannog

   The _Cave of Caerbannog_ has been well-established in the mythology
   of Camelot (as recounted by Monty Python) as the lair of the
   Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh, more commonly known today as the
   *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog* Clause 5.1 (Section 4.1).  It is the
   encounter between the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog and the Knights of

   the Round Table, armed with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch (see the
   following section (Section 4.2)), that we recount here through
   monospace font and multiple spaces.

4.1.  The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog

   The *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*, that most formidable foe of the
   Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been depicted
   diversely in lay and in song.  We venture to say, _contra_ the claim
   made in Section 4.1 of [RFC8140], that the Killer Rabbit of
   Caerbannog truly is the most afeared of all the creatures.  Short of
   sanctified ordnance such as Clause 5.2 (Holy Hand Grenade of
   Antioch), there are few remedies known against its awful lapine
   powers.

   The following depiction (Figure 3) of the fearsome beast has been
   sourced from Rabbit-SCII (http://camelot.gov.example/avatars/rabbit),
   accompanied (Figure 4) by C code that was used in this accurate
   depiction of the Killer Rabbit:

   The solution to the impasse at the Cave of Caerbannog*Holy Hand
   Grenade of Antioch* (see Figure 5) _Holy Spear of Antioch_ is purely
   intentional; _Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom_ (see Figure 6)
   is putatively fortuitous.

   Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch  Ordnance deployed by Brother Maynard
      under the incantation of a lector, in order to dispense with the
      Foes of the Virtuous.  See Figure 5.

   Holy Spear of Antioch  A supposed relic of the crucifixion of Jesus
      Christ, this is one of at least four claimed instances of the
      lance that pierced Christ's side.  Its historical significance
      lies in inspiring crusaders to continue their siege of Antioch in
      1098.

   Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom  Part of the Crown Jewels of
      the United Kingdom, the Sovereign's Orb is a hollow gold sphere
      set with jewels and topped with a cross.  It was made for Charles
      II in 1661.  See Figure 6.

   The instructions in the _Book of Armaments_ on the proper deployment
   of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch MAY be summarized as follows,
   although this summary SHALL NOT be used as a substitute for a reading
   from the Book of Armaments:

   2.  Feast of the People on Sundry Foods

       A.  Count is to Three: no more, no less

       B.  Not Four

       C.  Nor Two, except if the count then proceeds to Three

       D.  Five is Right Out

   5.  Lob the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards the Foe

   6.  The Foe, being naughty in the *LORD's* sight, SHALL snuff it

   This could also be represented in pseudocode as follows:

   1.  Take out the Holy Pin

   2.  The Count

       integer count;
       for count := 1 step 1 until 3 do
         say(count)
       comment Five is Right Out

5.1.  Past the Killer Rabbit

   Once the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog (Figure 3) had been dispatched,
   the Knights of the Round Table uncovered the last words of Joseph of
   Arimathea, inscribed on the Cave of Caerbannog in Aramaic.  While the
   precise Aramaic wording has not survived, we trust the following
   Hebrew subtitles will serve as an acceptable substitute:

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA might consider a registry to track the mythical, especially
   ravaging beasts, such as the Killer Rabbit, who haunt the Internet.

7.  Security Considerations

   Do not let the Killer Rabbit out under any circumstance.

   I repeat.  Do not let the Killer Rabbit (Figure 3) out.
